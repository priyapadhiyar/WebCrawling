(Dessert, Chocolate Tiramisu optional $5 extra).\\n\\nThe Garlic Bread has a great crust- it was seasoned well, garnished well, and the inside was soft.\\n\\nFrom my first bite of the Pasta Bolognese, I could tell that it's handmade. It was cooked Al Dente, and the sauce was good- it was sweet, but also light- not too heavy. The meat that it came with was also fantastically seasoned.\\n\\nThe Chicken Parmigiana was cooked just right. It wasn't overcooked as other places- the meat was still juicy and tender, but it wasn't undercooked either. The salad was okay, but I expected very little from a side salad.\\n\\nI did opt to get the Tiramisu and I had a glass of their Sicilian Red Wine (Firriato). The wine price was cheaper than comparative restaurants which is a plus. The Tiramisu had a generous portion of cocoa powder and I'm ashamed to say that I did choke on it several times. As for taste, the wine was very fresh (I saw Nino, the owner open it himself), and the Tiramisu was refreshing and sweet.\\n\\nWhile the portion sizes themselves are small, because it's a multi course meal, I left feeling very full.\\n\\nIt's a great restaurant and I will absolutely come again.\\n\\nJust a heads up though- the business hours have recently changed.

Well that had been sitting there for hours & looked horrible & unappetizing so no, I wasn't focused on that. I essentially just wanted a salad (it was hot out) & then saw there were like only 3 options which was lame. So i chose one & paid & then she's like oh well we don't have tomatoes or something. Seriously? That's a main ingredient in a salad, so how about you tell me when I order or before I pay. Come on. Of course I am not going to get that salad now. I get another one & waited for it. So I went home & couldn't believe it. That was one of the most pathetic salads I have ever had. There was hardly any vegetables in it & a tiny portion for what I paid. Nope, never again.

      "(107, '10/11/2018', '1 star rating', \"I've co-owned a local vegan restaurant and, prior to that I worked as a host, waiter, ice cream scooper, caterer, and bartender. In other words, I am intimately familiar with the food service industry, so I think my expectations are fairly realistic.\\n\\nAs a vegan, I tend to want to support all-vegan businesses over non-vegan businesses whenever feasible, but after lunch at Oasis today, I can emphatically say I won't support this business any further.\\n\\nToday was either my third or fourth visit since Oasis opened. None of my previous visits (all dinners) were remarkable, but the food was just fine, somewhat healthy, and I was happy to support another vegan business.\\n\\nI hadn't been since the weeks shortly after they first opened, but the menu hadn't changed significantly, other than lunch versus dinner (i.e., no mac and cheese). When I arrived, I was the only person waiting to order (one person was eating and the restaurant was otherwise empty). The person at the counter was helpful in explaining what was available and how combos could be put together. I ordered a small combo to dine in, as well as a smoothie. She pointed out they didn't have the maca for that smoothie, and I said I was fine with that. I paid about $15 and sat down.\\n\\nThe food combo came out fairly fast and she said the smoothie would be out shortly. I took my food to my seat and started eating, observing customers who came in after me while doing a little research on my phone for the upcoming election. The food was what I remembered: not as good as other places that make the same things (miser wat was kind of a spicy paste, the kale was just fine, and the grains were just fine; nothing to write home about).\\n\\nWhile eating, I saw people come in and order. In fact, I had an interaction with two first-time customers who were asking how spicy the miser wat was, and I offered my opinion, as I had eaten 3 bites already and found it fairly spicy (it's probably not that bad for people who like spicy, though). Before them someone else had come in and I believe he ordered while they were deciding.\\n\\nI returned to my food and notice a take-out customer carry two smoothies I had heard being made, and assumed I was getting my smoothie. There was still time to finish it with my meal. But take out is take out. Who knows when she called in her order? Fine. Surely mine would be out next.\\n\\nNo. 5-10 minutes after finishing my food I still didn't have a smoothie. I heard the blender going again, but one went to the man who ordered after me, and then two newcomers I'd spoken with earlier. They were confused that they had two smoothies that looked the same even though they ordered different smoothies, and I was wondering why three smoothies ordered *after* my smoothie came out and mine was still not even in the process of being made.\\n\\nSo I *finally* speak up. Of course, by this time, she does have a fairly long line at the counter, and it is just her working, and so she uses that as a way to explain why it's 20 minutes since I ordered and I still do not have my smoothie. This does not explain how she completed two other orders for people who came in after me. My guess is she forgot and didn't want to admit it, but who really knows? Remember, when I ordered, there was no one in line after me.\\n\\nAnyway, as my lunch break was ending, I left without a smoothie or a ~$6 refund, much less an apology for the underwhelming service. The most frustrating aspect of this interaction is how she didn't acknowledge that maybe she forget and would make it right away or whatever, instead of pushing back on my like I'm unreasonable for expecting a smoothie with 20 minutes. This is where I get pissed off and never want to come back again.\\n\\nSo, owners of the restaurant, I hope you see this. A friend recommended that I contact you on Facebook via IM, but I'm not looking for an interaction. This is not a recoverable experience for me anymore. That ship has sailed. Sure, you can try to turn things around at the restaurant based on this feedback. It really can't be that hard to improve things from here (you know, use an ordering system? make things in the sequence they were ordered?), but I can promise you that I won't be back.

Looks can be deceiving, though. It was so rich from the fryer that I don't think I would have eaten more if I could. With a super crunchy exterior, but a soft interior, it was delicious.

The bun was fresh and mouthwatering, the pulled chicken flavorful with smoky brown sugar barbecue coating, caramelized to perfection. Hints of crisp onions strings each falling onto the pallets in an utopian way. The fries crisp enough for a crunch and soft enough for them to be a pleasurable addition. And the slaw ? Oh the slaw.

Just $4 and you're on your way.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are actually excellent and live up to the hype. They are more generous than banh mi places in Chinatown.

I usually have a heavy, greasy aftertaste in my mouth & felt pretty shitty after finishing a Chinatown banh mi, but not from Ba Le. And get this, a banh mi here costs $4. That's outrageously cheap if you compared it to any other sub - you simply would not be able to find a sub (any sub) for less than $5, let alone one that tastes half as good. Then you have the fusion crap like Bon Me that literally costs twice as much but tastes awful.\\n\\nI also like the fruit smoothies here, namely durian and avocado. The lady that usually makes the smoothie does not understand English so you'll have to point to the paper menu and then tell her yes boba or no boba. For $3.50, they serve it in what looks to be a 20-oz cup, which is the best value in all of Boston for a fruit smoothie. The sugar cane is freshly squeezed, but it tasted odd the one time I got it, it tasted oddly sour; reading the fellow reviews, it sounds like she may have added orange juice. I like mine pure, may have to point that out next time.\\n\\nAll in all, Ba Le is hands down the BEST place to go for banh mi & fruit smoothie in the Boston area hence it gets a Woohoo! As god as it gets! rating. I have not tried many of the other food items here (spring rolls, vermicelli, etc.), but I'm willing to bet it's just as tasty. I safe to say that I will steer clear of Chinatown or anywhere else for banh mi, so long that Ba Le is around.\", '0', 510, 5)\n",

I don't blame them since most of these dishes take time to prepare and this is definitely not a sit-down restaurant, but still.

I visited once in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Each visit I ordered banh canh, which is basically Vietnamese udon, and every single time, they said they had run out.

      "(619, '3/2/2015', '4 star rating', \"Ba Le's banh mi is terrific. I saved one for two days in the fridge and reheated it for dinner in the convectional oven: the bread part was slightly crispy with a sweet aroma, still held up the hearty content inside, and tasted like it was just made fresh on the spot.\\n\\nThe anatomy of a banh mi is really quite something. Let's start with the bread. What makes a Vietnamese banh mi different from a French baguette starts with, is about, and ends with the bread itself. To me a good banh mi should be softer, less dense, more airy, shorter, wider, less floury, more buttery than a baguette. Slicing it in half takes some skill: the spine needs to be strong enough to hold all the content, especially if some liquid sauce is added, but the bread needs to open up enough to hold everything in. Ba Le, having sliced probably thousands of these, had no issue with this whatsoever.\\n\\nWhat goes inside the bread is all about diversity and balance. You can pick and choose the types of meat - depending on the kind, Ba Le would add either pate or chopped & sauteed scallions plus sweet fish sauce to your banh mi:\\n- For a nice, traditional, simple banh mi, you can get the cold cut (Vietnamese hams) which goes with margarine/mayo (made with egg yolks, oil, and sometimes a bit of lime juice - softer than butter, thinner than mayonnaise, this light golden goodness is truly a lovely thing in itself) and pate (usually thinner and more spreadable than traditional French mousse).\\nThen they add the veggies & herbs: pickled carrots & daikon (orange & white strings of crisp, slightly sweet, slightly tangy), cilantro, cucumber, and chili. Let them know if you want them all or none or just some. These balance out the hearty meat and the bready bread, so give them a try, you'll grow to like them.\\n- Beef is a pretty popular option, though some other banh mi places in Chinatown and Allston have proven to make the beef too sweet, so I've skipped the beef despite how hearty it is. I might try it next time I stop at Ba Le, hopefully they'll restore my hope in a good beef banh mi. This comes with the sweet & vaguely spicy fish sauce, the divine chopped & sauteed scallions.\\n- Shredded pork skin, pork slices, grilled ham... are also good options.\\n- I apologize for not having checked on whether they offer tofu.\\n\\nThe first bite likened a first kiss that magically felt immediately right: the bread smelled amazing and was thin enough to not steal the thunder, but strong enough to not let anything fall out; the meat burst into flavors that embraced the veggies and the super fresh cilantro. You know how sometimes you get bored with a dish half way into eating it? Not with a good banh mi, and certainly not with this banh mi I got from Ba Le. Every bite evolved into even more flavors than the last, and when over half of it was gone, I started dreading the end. I wished I never had to say goodbye, but the whole banh mi disappeared in less than ten minutes. I truly suggest you to take your time to enjoy and savor each bite. Eating banh mi shall be a fun, fulfilling, pleasant experience!\\n\\nTo truly complete the meal, get the sugar cane juice (juiced fresh inside Ba Le at the beverage counter.) Their smoothies are good, but sugar cane juice for me is the perfect, god-given partner to banh mi. When you can get fresh sugar cane juice it's better than many other juices or beverages you've ever tasted. Very addictive, very refreshing, very earthy.\\n\\nYou can also get lots of other things at Ba Le, ranging from hot food to desserts to all sorts of beef jerky to fruits to Tet (Vietnamese New Year) food. Oh fun, oh joy! I feel like a kid in this shop, being fascinated by just about everything. Give it a try! And give different things a try - if you don't like it, you know not to get it again.

They also have some various Vietnamese delicacies and grocery products. While there are no tables for seating, there is a park down the street with some picnic tables. So during a really nice day, you can order some Banh Mi and eat at the park while enjoying the nice weather.\\n\\nI decided to go for the Banh Mi Thit Nuong, which is the Barbecue Beef Banh Mi and I asked for it to be a little spicy. The baguette was toasty and crispy, the beef was chewy and flavorful, and the vegetables were crisp and I could taste some freshness. As I slowly continued biting through the Banh Mi, my tongue felt a great amount of spice inside, and it had made a significant difference in the taste.\\n\\nMy friend, who recently became a vegetarian, ordered the Tofu Banh Mi, and she said to me that she enjoyed it, and thought that it was probably one of the best sandwiches with a good value. She said to me that she was really glad that she discovered this place.\\n\\nThe lady who prepared my Banh Mi actually spoke pretty good English and was definitely friendly.\\n\\nI came back again, and got the #5, which is the Banh Mi Nem Nuong, which is the Cured Pork. I thought it was pretty tasty, especially the cured pork, the texture reminded me a little bit of eating some really tasty kielbasa sausage, even though they are completely different.\\n\\nOther than Banh Mi, I also wanted to get some of their other food as well. I saw a frozen shelf filled with some big buns that I usually see in a Chinese bakery. I decided to get one, and it was $1.50 a piece. This is called Banh Bao, and it's a bun filled with pork, boiled egg, sausage, onion, and mushroom. Although it was pricey for a bun, it was huge, as in it was almost 12 cm long and almost 8 cm high. I brought it home, and heated it up in my microwave on high around 40 seconds. I took a bite into the warm Banh Bao, and the bread was soft and fluffy, while the meat inside was tasty. One Banh Bao, when heated up, can make a really good and quick breakfast and even fill up your stomach.\\n\\nWhile my Vietnamese coworker has said to me that this is her primary choice to get Banh Mi, I would say that the Banh Mi here is slightly better than Boston's Chinatown, but not significantly better.

The iced coffee is very good as well. There's often a line, and some of the employees aren't necessarily fluent in English, but they churn out sandwiches very quickly and are very friendly. If I lived closer to this place I would eat here 1-2 times per week, but as it stands I am sure to stop by every time I'm nearby.

The dried fruits (mango, apricot, papaya) are cheaper and almost just as good as those at Whole Foods, and the lemons are 3 for 99 cents, cheaper than any other market around. The apples grown in Massachusetts are labelled as such. I love Lambert's also because of the layout, especially that they put all the potato chips and candies and sodas in a corner that I am not forced to walk through to get to the register. I like the\\nmanageable size of it, the mini carts, the sense of pride the employees seem to have in working for a small business that treats them well (staff turnover seems low). It's the closest thing we have in Dorchester to an old world market -- the focus is so clearly on produce, butcher, baker, deli, and their kick-ass salad bar. I can't get everything on my list here, but it's okay. While most of Dorchester feels like a food desert, this place feels\\nlike an oasis.\", '0', 812, 6)\n",

So for about a buck more I got a half of a chicken which was moist and delicious, plus an additional side dish.

Decent sized pork belly slice mixed well with the crunch of the lettuce and cilantro. Sauce was good too.\\n\\nKagoshima ramen: broth wasn't too heavy nor salty. It came with 3 slices pork belly, and 1/2 egg with some bamboo shoots. Noodles had a nice chew. Overall good but wasn't memorable.\\n\\nSakurashima ramen: broth felt more oily than spicy, which made it feel more heavy eating it. Also comes with 3 slices of pork  along with the same toppings as the Kagoshima. Again, just ok.\\n\\nFruit bingsoo: though it was generous portion for $5.50, it lacked the oomph. My biggest problem was they literally just put a dollop of red bean paste on top of the shaved ice which made eating it not as pleasant. I usually prefer actual red beans on the bingsoo. Almost wished that they could put some sort of condensed milk drizzle or some sauce on it to give the ice a bit of moisture or flavor.

Now let's get to the good stuff:\\n-The broth is delicious but not too heavy - perfectly balanced with the noodles and vegetables. The pork is tasty and you can tell it was given special attention - 4 slices of delegate, lightly-seared rectangles of porky-goodness. The noodles have a nice chew - perfect for slurping- and are not just an after-thought like most ramen spots.  The egg was perfectly cooked - not too runny but not hard boiled at all -perfect for dipping your noodles in and getting messy. This is an easy 9/10 for me.\\n-Just like what you'd expect at a cute coffee shop - the spot is small but the tables are well spread out (so you can slurp to your heart's content) and the service is what you expect at a mom-and-pop kind of establishment. Waters are frequently filled and the bar is often stocked with freshly baked cookies and treats (if you still have room).\\n- P.S. The pho is also phenomenal - comes with flank, tripe, and meatballs and is an ABSOLUTE BARGAIN at 9 dollars a bowl.  \\n- P.P.S - they also offer rice plates that have the same quality for those in your party that do not want to slurp.\\n\\nOverall, I HIGHLY recommend Neponset Cafe for your average/expert noodle-head.

Yes, we did enjoy 3 courses - appetizer, entrees, and dessert - but still, there were several rather long lulls as we waited for someone to come by to take our order, to bring our entrees, to offer the dessert menu, to take our credit card (they don't take American Express, by the way).  And I never received the hot water I asked for.  Okay, that's it for the griping.  On to better things.\\n\\nTheir regulars are enthusiastic about the food and love to share it.  As we were audibly mulling over the Lemon Lamb Kebab $18.95 (Cube pieces of lamb marinated with cream cheese, black peppers, lemon juices and spices for 24 hours and cooked in tandoor (clay oven) until tender, served with lemon butter sauce and bhatora (fried flour bread)) on the Chef's Specials sheet, our neighbors at the next table volunteered that they had selected two entrees off that sheet, and that they loved the lamb dish.\\n\\nIn addition to the lamb, we selected the Shrimp Malai Curry $12.99 (Fresh shrimp cooked in a mild coconut and onion sauce, tempered with curry leaves, carrots, ginger and raisins), and decided on the Mixed Vegetable Pakoras (6) $4.95 (Fresh cut vegetables deep fried in chick-pea batter) as a starter.\\n\\nTwo of the three sauces on the table were spicy, so I stuck to the tamarind sauce to accompany both the free Papadum (yummier than any of my past experiences) and the fried up balls of veggies (not greasy).\\n\\nThe lamb arrived as a nice heap of tender chunks with a bowl of the tasty lemon (but oddly orange in color) sauce and four beautiful pillows of poofy bread.  The shrimp was tender as well, but were only perhaps 5-6 of the shellfish hiding in a generous pool of really yummy sauce.  I also enjoyed the tender rice that arrived with the curry dish.\\n\\nFor dessert we elected to share the Gulab Jamun (2) $3.95 (Deep fried wheat and milk balls, soaked in sugar syrup) and the Kheer $3.95 (Rice pudding cooked with sweetened milk, garnished with raisins, almonds and saffron) since I knew my friend liked rice pudding.\\n\\nThe Kheer was aromatic and tasty without being too sweet.  It was watery rather than creamy, and the rice grains stood alone, but it was a nice treat.  The Galub Jamun was interesting since the fat balls were entirely soaked in the sweet liquid.  I'm glad I tried both, but for me the stars of the meal was the mix of the sauces and the accompanying carbs.\\n\\nBased on this, my initial experience at Shanti, I must say that if it wasn't for the inconvenient location (well, to me anyways), I'd be glad to come back when I had time for a leisurely meal... and soon.\\n\\n*** 12/2012 ***\\n\\nOddly enough, we were only the 2nd (and final - we closed out the night) dine in party of the evening one dreary Sunday evening.

The music that played (when it wasn't that one song in English that was a bit too jarring) was pleasant and didn't overwhelm the conversation.\\n\\nThe complimentary Papadum was light and crisp and flavorful.\\n\\nThe two of us demolished nearly our entire dinner of 1 bread, 2 meat dishes, and 2 desserts.

YAY!!\\n\\nComing to the challenge itself. Well. Where to begin? I will try to make this as short and sweet (despite the Xtreme heat) as possible. Try is the word... First of all - I would NOT recommend this challenge to anyone - friends, family, enemies, strangers or anyone in between. I mean the dish was that bad. Not that I was expecting it to be delicious - because, c'mon, who am I kidding. The challenge clearly states - very spicy hot dish - so the goal was to make you suffer with the heat index. Which I was ready for. The thing that disappointed me the most about the dish was that - I understand the heat level was raised to a 99 out of a max worst case 100 possible, the fact the entire dish lacked flavors or taste of anything else but that of red chilli powder in it's entirety - was really sad for me. I was hoping that the heat would make my mouth and tongue and my lips and my head burn but at least I would be able to taste some sort of flavors in it's sheer nastiness. But no, this dish was devised to almost disgust you at so many levels. I left the restaurant swearing I would never have a Vindaloo dish ever in my life. That was a heat of the moment thought and dissipated as soon as I sat in the Uber on the way back home. But really, I wish the dish had some flavors of something other than just the hot chili.\\n\\nTips for anyone who decides to take this challenge:\\n\\n- The biggest key to success in this challenge is to not drink too much water despite the need to do so given how hot the dish is.\\n\\n- Make use of the bowl of rice and divide your portions by mixing the dish with the amount of rice in the one bowl that comes with it. You may be tempted to mix more rice to try to finish the first 2 spoon fulls of vindaloo that you attempt to eat and find your mouth burning after the second bite. Don't do that. You may end up exhausting the first bowl of rice and will be left with more than half the dish still in it's bowl and will have no option but to either ask for a second bowl of rice or eat the dish - minus any rice. A fail in either case.\\n\\n- Considering the above 2 points, the biggest clincher would be - Try to finish the dish (literally eat it without trying to taste anything that you are chewing) as QUICKLY as you possibly can. I cannot be any more graphic although I am tempted to use the words - don't chew, swallow spoon fulls, don't chew, try not to taste, and such...\\n\\nOther notes: After successfully finishing my dish, I was left panting for loads of water (which I consumed) and a dire need for something super sweet. I ordered the Mango Lassi - big mistake. It had ice cubes - so wrong. Made it more watery and less sweet. Lassi is Never supposed to have ice cubes in it to begin with. Had I known this before hand, I would have never ordered it. Again, lesson for the future.\\n\\nWhy the 3 stars? Because thanks to the win, I have an opportunity to come back for my free entree - YAY! Given this dish, I wanted to give it a 1 star - which really wouldn't make any sense. 2 would have been unfair too because - hey, I decided to take the challenge. Why bring down the rating because of that? My support team - my partner had the Chicken Tikka Masala. The review I got about that dish: Ah, I've had better Tikki (so wrong to call tikka masala as Tikki masala btw) masalas several times in my life. In fact Vic, you make much better Tikki masala than this. So there...\\n\\nI'll be sure to update this space when I've had my much deserved free entree from Shanti.

Typically, it's a good sign when there is foot traffic at a restaurant, and I'm glad to say Shanti has it.  \\n\\nMy most recent discovery about Indian food is the Korma, I usually get Tikka Masala or Vindaloo, which is why going with friends is good (so you can try all the different food and maybe some conversation), but in our case no need because it's a buffet and when it's just me and the girl it's strictly straight to the business.  Naturally, with my recent love for the Korma, I was excited to come to this place, but unfortunately it wasn't offered as part of the buffet that day, bummer maybe we just went on an off day. From what I can remember they offered, Vegetable curry, Beef Curry, Chicken Tikka Masala, and one more I don't remember that was basically black beans with curry.  \\n\\nMy personal favorites were the Beef Curry (on the saltier side) and the Chicken Tikka Masala (probably one of the better Masalas I had in awhile). For the price of 8.99, this deal is hard to beat, especially for the quality of the food offered at a buffet.  Of course, being the bottomless pits that we are, aside from the buffet food, we ordered a plain naan, garlic naan, onion naan, and a paratha (told you we can eat), ohhh and of course had to wash everything down with a mango lassi. The breads were all good and buttery and my lassi was a bit watery (kinda disappointed), but everything else was good.  Wanted my drink to go, hoping it'll be in a to go cup and a straw, but the server came out with a plastic bag, over a brown paper bag, with my drink in a to go soup cup haha. All in all good lunch spot and good value, glad we came here for our first time Indian buffet experience.\", '2', 1117, 8)\n",

This most recent time, however, they got the memo and made it delightfully spicy.

When I arrived, I placed my order for take-out and was told after I placed my order that I had to dine-in to redeem the Groupon. Ok. Fine. Why not? I'm in no rush. I just wish I knew that ahead of time. I didn't really mind. I decided to make a nice evening of it. Here is how it went:\\n\\nAtmosphere: As I sat waiting for my food, I looked around, I made some observations on atmosphere. The restaurant was overall ambient, trance-like, dim (a bit too dim, but not bothersome, attractive, and generally quiet other than the light traditional music, which served as a nice touch.\\n\\nService: The restaurant was quiet and there were really only 4 tables (including mine) occupied. Normal for a Wednesday night. I sat by the window and was promptly given a glass of water, some thin/crispy wafer things that were spiced (please forgive me food world for not knowing the name of these things), and a mini selection of Indian spiced sauces (one of which I positively identified as tamarind...mmmm, my favorite!).\\n\\nHere's the downside. I wasn't offered a drink menu or even asked if I had thought about getting anything other than water to drink. Oh well, sucks for them, because that would have increased their potential gratuity. (Yeah, I used to be a server.) On top of that, my water hadn't been refilled since the first glass, well after my entree was served. I had to flag down one of the only two servers working in the small restaurant to ask for what should have been standard.\\n\\nThe servers barely made eye contact and weren't very welcoming, and they were far from attentive. My server smiled more at the female server, flirting and chatting at the register. One of the chefs from the kitchen came out and he seemed very friendly. He made eye contact, smiled and waved. We had a friendly moment. I wish he was my server. At least I know the food was made with a smile. (I hope!)\\n\\nI flagged one of the servers down to ask to pack up my food, and was obliged by the female waitress. She at least offered dessert. But still, the overall attitudes were just so ho-hum that I ended up almost feeling the same way! In all, service was awful! It's not like they were busy! No excuse!\\n\\nFood: Pretty decent! The Vegetarian Samosas that I had as an appetizer were large and plump with sweet, crispy dough and tasty filing that paired well with the three sauces.\\n\\nFor an entree I ordered the vegetarian Nabaraton Korma (Nine different kinds of vegetables cooked in a mild creamy sauce and garnished with nuts.) It was indeed creamy and slightly spicy. Flavorful (but could have been more) with a nice blend of veggies to balance the texture of the sauces. I will say that the rice seemed very dry and lacked the scent and essence of Basmati rice that I've had elsewhere with other traditional Indian fare.  Presentation was nice, but there was not as much food as I expected at the price that was offered. I seriously could have gotten more for less elsewhere!\\n\\nI also decided to try something new and ordered the Peshawary Naan (Unleavened flour bread stuffed with raisins, almonds, coconuts and pistachio), which was sweet, warm, flavorful, and a nice size. It wasn't over cooked, and was quite tender, not chewy. Only downside was that the only ingredient that I could actually taste or even FIND in the Nann was coconut! I didn't realize this until after the fact, when I really opened it up later. I had only taken a couple of pieces while I was eating.\\n\\nTo top it all off, the prices of the food items were higher on the physical menu than they had been on the website's menu by $1 each. It turns out that I ended up spending more than I expected. A few more dollars (before figuring in gratuity) than I expected. I've gotten more for less elsewhere.\\n\\nI would give this place a 4 if they weren't so overpriced and lackadaisical about service, etc. However, they seriously dropped the ball.

Whenever we ate at some other restaurant, we'd sigh and say that it didn't come close to Shanti. Shanti serves the tastiest, freshest Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi food at quite reasonable prices. Well, I couldn't help myself, once I'd savored the sweet pieces of lamb in that spicy sauce, I ordered my wife's favorite item, the Saag Paneer as a take-out order.  Since I was heading to the airport right after eating, I had my travel bags with me. I stowed it in my luggage wrapped tightly in plastic. When I arrived back in Charleston, South Carolina, 1,000 miles away, I pulled out the package and gave it to Janet as a surprise long-distance delivery! It was still warm when she opened it up. The room filled with the aroma of heavenly and aromatic spices. I smiled as she ate it up. Do we have to wait another 6 years to order from Shanti again?  I know you deliver!  Y'all come on down and open up in one of the great food capitals of the planet. Charleston would welcome you with open arms and their gracious hospitality. Our governor is Indian! Y'all would trample the competition!\", '0', 1274, 8)\n",

Cafe Mamtaz in South Boston does an outstanding job with this favorite of ours. Maybe I'm spoiled. The garlic naan was good but the basmati rice was also a huge disappointment.

I asked if it was basmati and was told it  was.\\nfyi: I noticed a sound from the kitchen and I'm afraid to say that I think it was the microwave.

Juicy tender meatball, fresh homemade pasta with a wonderful red sauce topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese.\\nThe open concept kitchen as i said earlier is a great idea, but if your going to have one, don't microwave the eggplant parm in saran wrap then plate it up and add more sauce to it in the kitchen in front of everyone.\\nThey sold quite a lot of eggplant parm whilst i was there which begs me to ask the question, why do you need the microwave? You could have made a tray of them fresh and baked them up upon an order coming in, i for one would have no problem waiting for fresh baked.\\nThe chef seemed very competent and was skilled in his presentation and execution, apart from overcooking my friends shrimp dish (rubber shrimp is no fun for anyone!) i know most restaurants have microwaves, but in Molinari's it looks so out of place.\\nThey have a full bar so i had a beer, all good, some others in our party had a basic red wine and was shocked when the bill arrived to see it was $13 a glass. You might get way with that in the North End or downtown Boston but in Dorchester?\\nThe staff were wonderful with the exception of the owner....\\nUpon inspection of the bill we noticed 2 kids meals had been added, seeing as there were no kids in the group we questioned the charge and was told it was an up charge for home made pasta. If this had been noted on the menu when ordering i would still have gone with the homemade pasta, but to arbitrarily add it to a bill is way out of order. Making the entrees look reasonably priced on the menu then adding money at the end is the old bait and switch.\\nWhen we questioned the owner he was completely unmoved by our cries of foul play, in fact he dismissed it as though we were out of order to question him, completely unprofessional conduct in my opinion which is the reason i won't be returning.\", '2', 1049, 9)\n",

The conflict that I have with this restaurant is the wait time...for a pick-up order. The point of ordering ahead is that you don't have to wait for your food to be cooked. The quoted pick-up time is usually 20-25 min after the online order is placed. I go there and then I end up having to wait anyway. The last two times that I went, I had to wait 35 min once and another time approximately 20 min - and that is on top of the 20-25 min quoted time online.\\n\\nWhy does this happen? Well, I like a little char but I always order my pizzas with lightly cooked option as I find Molinari's signature char to be too much.

So I end up waiting. :( Not a great experience.\\n\\nThe owner is a nice guy and provided some complimentary cannolis. But, I rather have a pizza ready for me when I get there.

The sweet hostess estimated about 40 minutes. Sure, no problem. It was busy, it was Thursday, and I have no problem waiting with a margarita to sit when our friends that we were with had been a few times and liked the food.\\n40 minutes roll by as we watch tables get up and leave, and sit vacant. Checked with the hostess- 5-10 minutes, next on the list. Sure, we'll get an order of chips/guac/salsa going at the window bar seat we were able to snag and carry it over to our table.\\nSuddenly it was 8:50, and we're still waiting watching a table of three older women (who were already done eating when we arrived at 7:10) be surprised when a girlfriend ordered another round of drinks for the table as a vacant two top sat empty on one side of them. I get it. They're paying customers, probably regulars, probably someone's mom, but when the sweet young hostess isn't sitting ANYBODY because management told her to sit in order, and she's counting on these squatters to finally vacate so she can push the tables together to accommodate a four top for our party, something had to give. My girlfriend took a stroll to the bathroom, past the tables, and noticed two other vacant tables near the back.\\nIt hits 9:00 and I finally ask to speak to someone to ask the honest question- are we going to sit or not? Manager for the night (whom I thought was a patron since I saw him near the back in the bar area the entire night) comes over and apologizes for the wait. When we're nearing close to two hours after originally being told 40 minutes and all you can offer is an apology- that is not going to fly to keep a restaurant successful when us and other groups are observing empty tables and getting creative on how to get things moving.\\nMy suggestion to him; we noticed there are a few empty tables further back, and these women just ordered another round of drinks. Since the hostess mentioned we were next on the list, and these ladies have been occupying a table for HOURS with no food, why don't you ask them to finish their drinks at one of the vacant two tops so you can accommodate us, and the other groups that have been waiting. We received an oh, that's an idea. Cool, bro. Nothing. Watched him retreat back to his corner in the back of the restaurant.\\nAt this point we were way too frustrated with the lack of initiation from management to even consider sticking around to eat dinner. Went to close out our tabs at the bar, and the bartenders (so attentive, so great at what they do for how busy it was) noticed how everything hit the fan just handed us cards back with essentially everything comped. A class act from the floor staff to try and rectify how poorly the restaurant is run.\\nIf you notice that you have a small place, known to throw out some good tacos and cocktails, there needs to be a better system to the madness. Limits on table time in place that doesn't accept reservations isn't unreasonable. Kindly asking groups (that bring overnight bags) to finish their drinks at the bar isn't unheard of. Having staff actually move from the back of the bar, or a host get off her chair when she sees that time is passing by without seating people to check in waiting parties isn't unheard of.\\nHopeful that this place can figure out a better way to accommodate their patrons, but based on last night's experience, it seems like the amount of growing from management won't be able to catch up to where this place wants to be success wise.\\n\\n-Guac was decent, but glad I didn't have to pay for it.\", '0', 1130, 10)\n",

I would like to tell you that this place is among my favorite.\\n\\nMy Pre-Grad dinner was here with my obnoxious group of friends. We made dinner reservation for 5:30. Me, who does not know how to show up late, always come too damn early. I was too early but went inside because it's May and it's still so damn cold. They were surprise that there was a reservation but I got seated anyway.\\n\\nI already had what I wanted to eat in my mind. At exactly 5:30 as planned only 3 more people showed up. Spanning from the time I was here 5:10 to the time the last person got here 6:15, I was very amaze they did not complain or give me angry eyes (like I've previous experience from so many restaurant). Bonus point for not being rude! Yes I should discipline my friends better to show up on time but I am not their mum.\\n\\nI got this time the Grilled pork + Fried Tofu + a side of Bi (pork skin basically): it was really good. I'm actually amazed at how delicious the Fried Tofu (Tau Hu Ky) is (of which I've had many). It was the thing I ate first and I was so full I barely touch my Bi (which is very sad). One of the better rice plates in Dorchy (IMO).\\n\\nFriends got a bunch of other stuff but w/e I was mad at them for coming late so idc they probably enjoyed their food though from a variety of pho to sizzling plates.\\n\\nI felt bad for the server as we were drinking our ice tea pot too damn quickly between the 13 of us. Our group kept on asking for refills to which they eventually gave up and brought us a giant pitcher of water.\\n\\nService this time was ok, since we had to track them down to get them to let us order. But it's probably my friends fault for coming late so they probably thought we wanted to wait for everyone to get here. But hell no I aint waiting 40 minutes for late people.\\n\\nWe ate, we paid (nicely they allow as many card as you want if more than $10/card). Easy.\\nRushed to dessert.\\n\\n3 hours later I would come back to order dinner for my mom.\\n\\nCanh Chua + Ca Kho To (Vietnamese Sour soup + Clay pot Caramellized Fish: The Canh Chua was ok. I've had it many times so I can say that it's not always consistent. Sometime it is absolutely excellent, other time quite mediocre. Ca Kho To though was super delicious and traditionally correct. Added a small portion of rice. For $35ish it was enough for feed 3 people for 2 meals. Definitely a great and affordable deal.\\n\\nPreviously on I EAT TOO DAMN MUCH:\\nBO 7 MON (7 Course Beef) and Ca 7 MON (7 Course FISH): Now I've had both on occasions and I would say the Beef course is slightly better. In term of flavor the beef dishes are more in-depth. Butter beef, Beef vinegar fondue, Beef wrapped in lot leaf, and Beef carpaccio salad   are consistently excellent. I've never made it to the rice porridge but it's always been a good take home for lunch the next day. The beef pate is ok, it's not a thing that I general like.\\n\\nCA NUONG CUON BANH TRANG (Fried Fish for paper wrapping): Now this is what I always want to get when I'm in Dorchester. I've had it at Saigon Seafood, Pho Le and Pho 2000. I would say Pho 2000 is slightly better then here in term of FRIED FISH. AH tie with SS in term of taste. AH greater than SS in term of service. Pho Le I had it like once it was fine. Always call ahead no matter where you go though, it take a long ass time to make and when you (aka me) travel all the way from Brookline to Dorchester just to eat this you want it to be freshly ready when you arrive. They give you a medium amount of veggies that you can always ask for more. The veggies amount isn't as generous as Pho 2000. Dipping sauce wise, Pho 2000 also have them beat.\\nBut I would say come to AH for your Beef Course. Of course.\\n\\nI would have tried many other things but honestly the 7 Course Beef is the best menu item so I never bothered to waste my calories on other things, but I've heard their Pho and stuff to be good. Mixed reviews on Bun Bo Hue. Banh Canh Cua is meh.\\n\\nBack to service, it's pretty up and down depend on the time you go and who's on. But I feel with Viet food the customer-base can be very needy with their constant requestsHey can you get me this, More of this please, More. More More. So I can total understand when they forget to bring you what you ask for since they probably have like 8000 things on their mind to remember to bring. So be nice to your server and don't make a giant scene. Tip nicely.\\n\\nThe lady who makes the drink and take care of takeout order/ money is always very nice and pleasant though.\\n\\nI rank Anh Hong high on my list, especially higher than Pho Le (who've previously been very good but now isn't as good as when they first open) and Pho Hoa. Service wise also better than Saigon Seafood. In term of most likely to get a satisfying Vietnamese meal + no arguing with waiter for bad service, AH is a bar above the rest.\", '0', 1808, 12)\n",

He was very kind and apologized for the wait - however none of the other employees in the kitchen (which is wide open for view) seemed to notice us standing there. There was a young woman on her phone in the back. She might have been on her break or just doesn't work the kitchen, but in my experience doing any type of customer service, even if it's not your job you acknowledge the customers and at least say, someone will be right with you. That was a turn off.\\n\\nCLEANLINESS/PRESENTATION:\\nBy no means was I expecting a fancy shmancy place, given it's burgers and fries, but when a place has gourmet in its name, the expectations are a little bit higher than normal. I was disappointed that the food prep area behind the register was in disarray. It is an open kitchen and you can see practically everything they're doing. I'm the type of person who really takes into consideration the cleanliness of a place, specifically if I'm eating. I understand that they just opened and are probably just getting things together, but the mess turned me off.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nOverall, the food was good. I can't say it was the best burger I've ever had, but it was good. The brioche bun was buttery and the garlic aioli was tasty. I hope Bred continues to see success so that the owners can invest more in how the place looks and, perhaps, in expanding their menu just a bit because I felt limited to the classic Bred, and was hoping for something a little different.\\n\\nPRICE:\\nThe total was about $31 give or take for two Bred Classics, sweet potato fries and an order or truffle fries, as well as two 20oz drinks.

The additions are inventive, just as flavorful and compliment the burgers well. On our first visit there, I had the Parisian - grass-fed bison, cartelized onion, bacon, brie, mushroom and a free-range egg. I get why it's served on a brioche bun - keeping with the French theme - but that type of bun is too weak corral the pile of juicy ingredients in between. It flattened and got soggy in a few bites. With all the juice and bacon and running egg going on, a more substantial bun is in order (maybe a pretzel bun?). Their basic Bred burger is good as well (have yet to try the Bred salmon which sounds interesting on paper). The fresh ingredients are a nice touch in the world of frozen, boxed and canned stuff, so they get points for that.\\n\\nTheir fries, however, leave something to be desired. Fries are my go-to for a burger sidekick and Bred needs to step up their game here. Just because sweet potato fries have the name sweet in them doesn't mean you have to make them, well, sweet. Their sweet potato fries have a dusting of...something to make them sweeter than natural. Sugar? Cinnamon? As a counterpart to a burger, it's a weird and not very pleasant juxtaposition. Just let the fries have their own natural taste. Meanwhile, my regular fries were limp, undercooked sticks of grease that set us back $5. A minute or two longer would have made the difference between crispy sticks of heaven and potatoes I needed to wring out before eating.\\n\\nFinally, I know that Bred has the name gourmet in their name, but still think most people would flinch a bit at two burgers, a small order of sweet potato fries and a large order of regular fries and NO drink for nearly $50.\\n\\nI've glad Bred is there as an alternative to the sameness of most of the smaller food places in the area, but as of now it's about third on the list of options.

Coming from cities like Lynn and Chelsea that had all the Central American and Mexican food you could ask for definitely made me picky. Most places claim to be 'authentic' Mexican restaurants when they shouldn't even claim to be tex-mex restaurants. El Barrio Taqueria is not like those other restaurants. It's great! This tex-mex taqueria seems to have a great balance between modern and traditional. My husband and I ordered take out through Grubhub and it was so quick. The food was still hot when it came! We ordered two chicken empanadas and two quesadillas-one carne asada and one carnitas. The carne asada was tender and flavorful. The carne asada in the quesadillas reminded me of a backyard carne asada with the fam because it had that nice char over the grill flavor! The carnitas quesadilla was salty in a good way. Both quesadillas came with crema on the side and some tomato salsa (not spicy). The chicken empanadas were good but a little dry. I'm guessing that the delivery aspect of it might have been a factor in how dry they were. I can imagine their juicer when you order them in the restaurant and eat them while their piping hot. The empanadas reminded me of something my Puerto Rican fam would make so I can definitely taste the blend of other Latin flavors in this taqueria. I didn't ask for some hot sauce or spicy salsa in my order because I thought it would come with the order, but I'm assuming they offer that when you eat in the restaurant.

The chimichanga was generously stuffed, crisp but not greasy, and the salsa verde and avocado topping were fabulous.  The plantains were tender, flavorful, and also not at all greasy; the black beans were served warm in their own little dish, like a little bowl of soup.

We only ordered two entrees to share between three people. The mofongo was interesting--I'd never tried green plantains before so it was a new experience. The sauce(? gravy?) complemented it well and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. The other entree was a carne asada with sweet plantains and fries.

The woman behind the counter waited on me and prepared my chicken burrito. (10.50)  the meal came as a large burrito filled with what seemed to be a pre mixed rice and chicken combination, although it could have been separate.  Next to the burrito was a dollop of sour cream a very small portion of guacamole, and a bit of fresh lettuce and tomato garnish.  On top of the burrito was a bit of cheese.  I was surprised to not find refried beans or a portion of black beans with this dish.  I don't know if my server forgot; were they out?...  Served in a rectangular Styrofoam container.\\nThe Good:\\nLots of fresh cilantro in the guacamole, in the salsa that came with the chips also.  The food tasted like what I would expect from a mex, kind of place. The woman who helped me was very friendly.   My meal came with a little bag of tortilla chips and a small container of salsa (chips tasted like they weren't made there.  Taco Real on Dot ave has chips fried on premise)\\nThe Bad:\\n$10.50! That same burrito comes wrapped in tinfoil from Anna's or any other burrito joint for $5.45 (guac. & SC $1.40.) $6.85  That's over a 50% premium to get the burrito in a Styrofoam plate with the guac and sour cream and cheese on the outside, not wrapped tightly enough to pick up.  I know: they are going for restaurant style, and on a plate in a restaurant with table service, and beer and wine the price would be about right, if they put a dollop of refried beans on the side, and increased the size of the tomato and lettuce garnish enough to be called a salad, at least...\\nThe Verdict:\\nIt was OK, nothing was bad.  I was the only customer getting takeout, the woman helping me at 1:30 was there alone,  I can't imagine what would have happened if one or two more people came in.  They are the only mex place nearby so I guess they have a captive audience and the good yelpers are just excited to have a local place.

I am not that big of a raw onion fan so when I picked these out there was really not much left in there.\\nMy one other complaint was we had a really nice waiter who chatted up a storm, but because he chatted SO much we ended up being there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. There were only two or three other tables but it was really hard to get his attention because he always seemed to be off talking to a table or someone in the kitchen. So I think the staff could be a teeny more attentive to the customers, there are only about six or seven tables to cover. And this place is a lot pricier than I think Mexican food needs to be. I am still very excited to see a Mexican restaurant in the community tho, I'm sure they will work out the kinks soon.\", '0', 2331, 14)\n",

The reason why I'm only giving it three stars is because of the ramen and the manager on duty at the time. I came in today and ordered two lunch specials, one for ramen and one with three plates of meat. All three selections of meats were great, same as always, I upgraded to the beef rice for $3 which I thought was a good deal. Beef tongue was an extra $3 onto the combo, but it's my favorite so no complaints there! The ramen was extremely bland and even dumping an entire spoonful of soy sauce into it, it still tasted watered down. The broth was colorless to start with. Just imagine using double the amount of water when you're making instant ramen. When we told our server about it and she spoke to her manager. Instead of coming over to our table to speak with us directly, (she was literally standing only less than two feet away from us), she had her server go back and forth to ask us what the issue was with the ramen. They were standing so close to us that we can hear them speak to each other, so why not do what managers are supposed to do and come speak to us? When she realized that we were just looking directly at her waiting for her to come over, she did. There was no apology to the ramen being bland, she asked us if we wanted another one or something else - obviously not another ramen. She grabbed the bowl and took it back. She didn't offer any other solutions for us; it wasn't like we ate more than one spoon from the bowl where we just wanted free ramen, we returned an almost full bowl. Our server was great, though, and props to her for going back and forth to talk for her manager.\\n\\nI understand if you're thinking, why order ramen from a Japanese BBQ restaurant so of course it's not going to be as good - but this rating is solely on the service from management.

You'll get better food and DEFINITELY get better service elsewhere.\\n\\nGyu-Kaku is a chain, and apparently one that cares VERY VERY DEEPLY about policy. See, I left a work event to join a friend's birthday gathering at Gyu-Kaku, eight of us total. I joined about an hour into their dinner, when my friends were well into grilling and chilling; my thought was to join late, order a Ramen bowl and a drink, and carry on--which I've done countless times at other restaurants with zero issue. Not at Gyu-Kaku! I was told that, even if I didn't want to touch a bite of my friends' dinner, I'd be paying the full 50 dollars per head, which each of them were paying, to simply sit at the same table. This was, apparently, due to policy, a word that would be repeated more in the next 5 minutes than in an entire United Nations working session.\\n\\nThree different (inept) managers tried explaining to me just how difficult and impossible it would be to determine how to bill the table if I were sitting there, and thus, the ONLY POSSIBLE thing to do would be to charge me full price. The ONLY possible way! No possible solutions around it!\\n\\nWell, except one: I was insultingly given the option of sitting at an adjacent table (mind you, the restaurant was empty....) as a remedy.... as if somehow my awkward seating placement would MAGICALLY resolve the VERY DIFFICULT AND IMPOSSIBLE question of how to bill my order.\\n\\nWas I asking for unique treatment? Objectively, yes; I had arrived late, and was trying to order my own meal. Was it an objectively unreasonable request? As someone who's worked in the service industry: absolutely not, ESPECIALLY considering this was a special event (a friend's birthday!), and doubly considering this policy was never made clear to me or any of us, frankly.\\n\\nIf you're in the area and craving Japanese barbecue at a steep price point? Go for it! But I would absolutely discourage people from going here for any sort of special event, lest you want stiff, uncaring ~management (a generous term) to ice you out. Special occasions (and really, dining and hospitality in general) beget some degree of flexibility, for both customer and employee; Gyu-Kaku, as a corporate chain, clearly doesn't understand this.\\n\\nFinally, it's worth noting that this policy actually LOST them the business of an entree/app/at least two drinks that I would have ordered, nevermind the effect of discouraging me from returning and the damper this put on my friend's birthday (nearly all of us agreed afterwards we won't return--so, good job y'all, you lost six local customers). Not great for a new business, and hopefully, corner-office management learns from such experiences as they craft new policy.\", '0', 2366, 15)\n",

So, you should expect to wait -- for everything.\\n\\nPROs: The food is delicious. You can't go wrong. It's a bit pricey, but if you're a big eater, you can make up for it value-wise by indulging in one of their buffets. :-) The menu is large, and the meats are fresh. The servers and hosts are pleasant, and the manager comes around and tries to say hello to everyone to check in. The place is generally clean.\\n\\nCONs: There is really only one con to this restaurant, but it's a big deal, and it seems unique to this location and not the other Gyu-Kakus. They seem to have a problem managing their queues. At first, I thought it was because it's so popular in the area (it's relatively new, I believe), and when I usually come on Fridays and Saturdays, it seems packed with a long waitlist that can run up to 2.5 hours. Then I started coming during lunch. Even with a half-full restaurant, I still have to wait 20+ minutes to get a seat. For both lunch and dinner, it takes awhile for the servers to bring out the dishes. I think that's something they can fix; it should not take that long to put some raw slices of meats on to a plate and deliver it to your customer. I can't help but feel like they're understaffed. For example, they typically have one host, and somehow, she seems like she's off somewhere else half the time. I don't get the sense that she's slacking off... she's probably trying to help the restaurant in some fashion with some customer... but perhaps hiring a second host to help manage the front of the restaurant would be good. Maybe also hire more busboys to clean the tables so I don't have to wait 20 minutes during lunch with a half-capacity room. Or bring in a consultant to see if they can identify what the bottleneck is.\\n\\nSIDE NOTE: As is the case with other restaurants like this where you grill food in front of you, you should expect to smell a little bit like your dinner after.\", '0', 2386, 15)\n",

As a person who moved to Quincy just recently, I am surprised at the lack of coffee shops of this type in the general area. Actually, Sugar Bowl is the first one I've come across. I've heard that there are other genuine places, but they all seem to close ridiculously early. Perhaps I was just spoiled by spending a year in Northampton...\\n\\nRegardless, Sugar Bowl is good, and could probably hold it's own in Noho. They have the standards - good coffee, espressos, lattes, etc., and some more innovative things. I ordered a mocha latte, and that was good. It wasn't the absolute best (that would be the mocha served at Esalon Cafe in Hadley, Mass.), but it was quite decent. I didn't try any other pastries, but there was a good variety, even just before closing. And ice cream - there was ice cream, which I also did not try.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was exactly what a coffee shop should be. Sort of cute, sort of cozy. Several tables with chairs, a stuffed chair, and lighting that was not overly bright.

That's why it is always shocking to me that they play the music they do. They usually play a radio station with lots of commercials and Kelly Clarkson and Christina Aguilera songs repeating over and over and over. I am so disappointed with this. The decor is so idiosyncratic, if the music were too, the place would just be incredible. Why not play music from the 50's or ragtime 20's, or instrumental, or folk, or mix it up, etc.??  ANYTHING BUT THE POP garbage that plays? Why does the place have to sound like every other Dunkin Donuts, or gas station, or teenage girl' s bedroom? The music, along with radio commercials broadcast over the shop, just gives this place a gross feel. Sophisticate it up a little with the music, and I think the place will just feel a touch more relaxing and cohesive. If the music is more suiting, the place will still have its local, unpretentious feel, and it will become even more inviting.\\n\\nThe coffee is OK. I would not recommend an espresso drink, unless you really specify the exact anatomy of the drink what you want. I ordered a cappuccino once because I really like the foam, and after waiting about 10 minutes (I was one of maybe two ppl in the place), the barista served up a mug filled to the brim with hot milk (no foam at all) that tasted only faintly like espresso. The for here mug also had a ring of dust stuck to the rim of it, like it had been sitting facedown in a dusty area and not wiped off. Eesh.\\n\\nThe baristas, on the whole, are not friendly. Well, they are to some of the people that must be regulars, but not to me who is sometimes standing in front of the counter waiting for them to finish up their conversation with the regulars, or finish up scratching that lotto ticket at the table with a regular, etc.\\n\\nThe baristas are not efficient. Every time I order, without fail, they walk away after the first item comes out of my mouth, to the point that it's comical. For instance, say I am going to order two coffees, one with cream, one black, an english muffin with jam and a bagel toasted with cream cheese. I might say, Hi, I would like two coffees, one with cream.. and poof she's gone- already at the other end of the store, making that coffee and cream. I have to wait for her to finish and come back with it before I can order the second coffee, or the food. Having worked in the food industry for years (or even just being a person with a little common sense--this isn't rocket science) I know how important it is to get the WHOLE order before walking away so that you can prioritize and multitask so as to make the food in an efficient manner. Like, if she knew about the bagel and english muffin, she could have first put them in the toaster while pouring the coffees, and shaved a good 5 minutes off everybody's wait time.\\n\\nThe owner is very charming. He shows up often, and will offer new customers a free coffee card to thank them for coming, and will chat with the older customers.

Similarly prepared beef slices with a spicy marinate, wrapped the same way as the first course. A sizzling twist.\\n\\nThe third course was a type of beef salad, with marinated rare beef slices, peanuts and herbs.

It's a perfect dish to be enjoyed between the cold and hot meat courses, true comfort food for the stomach.\\n\\nThe fifth, sixth and seventh dishes came together. One is a type of Vietnamnese meatball which comes with shrimp chips. I had to skip the chips because by this point I was sufficiently full. The meatball itself was delicious, with minimal things beyond meat, the flavor is light and not overwhelming. The herbs and peanuts intertwined inside the meatball adds an additional zesty flavor to it. The second one was a type of sausage wrapped inside banana leaves, I think the leaves help to absorb the oil from the sausage itself. The sausage was well prepared, extremely flavorful, a combination of spicy, sweet and salty, tenderly cooked, the meat is a little less lean than the beef slices, It's one of the heavier dishes in the 7 course meal. The last but not least, it's my favorite, it's a beef-rollup wrapped around a piece of onion. What flavor, the beef was so perfectly prepared, the marinate exquisite.

The restaurant is small and pretty tightly packed but all that matters is the food.  \\n\\nMy go-to's are the fresh spring rolls, salt and pepper calamari, tofu salad for appetizers, and then a large Pho 2000 and a fried catfish for entrees.  The spring rolls are always perfectly balanced with shrimp, pork, vermicelli and mints.  The peanut sauce compliments it perfectly and these are always a crowd pleaser.  The calamari here is by far my favorite of any restaurant.  Lightly fried and tossed with spices and peppers, you get a good kick with every bite.  This dish is not too heavy and I recommend it to anyone that comes to Pho 2000.  I'm not a huge tofu fan but whatever they do to this tofu is magic.  The combination of the freshness of the greens and the seasoning/marinade they use on the tofu makes this dish packed full of flavor.  The broth in the Pho 2000 is the best I've had.  I'm a bare bones guy so I rarely add any Sriracha or plum sauce and the straight flavor of the broth is perfect for me.  They give you a good amount of meat and noodles.  This bowl is sure to make you happy and ready to take a nap.  The fried catfish varies in size but it is always a meaty, lightly fried catfish that is very fresh.  If you like to go above and beyond, they bring you all of the accoutrements so you can make your own rolls with sprouts, herbs, apple, etc.  I tend to eat the catfish straight with some rice and plum sauce but any iteration of it is delicious.\\n\\nYou can't go wrong with anything you get here.

You spin the rice paper in the hot water to melt it until it's loose.

Garnished beef slices and a butter frying pan (on the flame heater) to cook them in.\\n3. Top quality raw beef in lime juice with peanuts to eat RAW (yeah!)\\n4.

A skewer of marinated onion slices wrapped in beef.\\n\\nQ ::: Anything else?\\nA :::: What more do you want??! We were so full it was ridiculous. A good bit of advice would be to take it easy on making the summer rolls - you can get too full too quickly, don't rush. Also it's probably not wise to get their gorgeous avocado shake - that's not exactly lite fare either. Instead be brave and have the lovely salty plum soda.\\n\\nQ ::: Going back?\\nA :::: For sure.

Seventh, came the peppery beef and basil congee. Wasn't sure when we were supposed to stop using the rice paper but I used it for courses 1-6.

After Yelping, I decided to try Pho 2000 for Sunday brunch in order to introduce my BF to the 7 courses of beef.  Unfortunatedly, we partied a little hard Saturday and the BF was profoundly hung over, and we know--and everyone else should learn--that Pho is the best hangover cure ever!  So we ordered one bowl of Pho to share as well as the 7 courses of beef for two.  Needless to say, that was waaaayyyy more food than we could have consumed.  The Pho's broth was impressively fragrant, sweet, and nicely fatty--which might turn off those health-conscious people, but this really is the authentic Vietnamese way of serving it.  (In CA Pho places offer the option of a small bowl of scallions poached in beef fat to be added to the broth for more authenticity) The thinly sliced beef was clearly fresh as it had a healthy pink color.  We both agreed that the broth was very good--though not the best ever, I would venture to say that it rivaled many very good places in So Cal.  So as my BF lovingly dove into his bowl, the 7 courses of beef started coming out.  I think I was most impressed with the authentic variety fresh vegetables and herbs plate, and secondly with the fact that they served it with mam nem (unfiltered fish sauce--overwhelmingly pungent smell, but oh sooooo good when well prepared!) I believe we made it to the 4th course before my BF confessed that he couldn't eat another bite.  Though good and especially surprising that it's available in Boston/Dorchester, the 7 courses of beef didn't particularly knock my socks off....though they did have all the right courses and good quality beef , there was just something missing/off in the flavoring (especially the bo la lot and bo lui), but still definitely very edible.

We shared a variety of appetizers and dishes off of the menu (from seafood to steak) to formulate an informed opinion that probably everything must be great, because everything we had really was. Perfect flavoring, nothing over/under cooked, and presentation was on point. I regret not taking pictures...but everything was gone before we remembered, and we barely had any doggie bags (we cleaned our plates).\\n\\nIf I had to complain about any one thing, I would say the check was kind of high.

The pork strips were covered in fat and grease to the point where you could not taste anything but greasy fat, which is pretty difficult to do considering sparerib sauce  is traditionally very strong. The beef teriyaki was borderline not beef, but some grade d cut of mystery meat soaked in grease and old marinade. The crab rangoon may have been two or three days old and were soggy besides the very outside edges, they tasted like they had been reheated in the microwave. I tried to give this place a second chance after getting the chewiest yet somehow over cooked orange chicken and stale fried rice I have ever had, but it was a huge mistake. There is no justification for ever stepping foot in this establishment. It should be condemned if for nothing else to not sully the good name of other whole in the wall Chinese food restaurants elsewhere in the city. Don't waste your time or money or good health on this place.

I didn't really like the flavor of any of the beers.  The pilsner was ok but did not look like a pilsner.  It was very cloudy and I've never thought that a pilsner should be cloudy.  Not sure what the intention was, but it just felt lazy or miscalculated by the brewer.  The stout just wasn't a stout by any measure.  It was dark, that's about it.  I don't even know what style it tasted like, but not like any stout I know.\\n2.  I HATE that they serve the beer in wicked cold frosty glasses.  I assume this is either to be funny, gimmicky, or to cover up bad flavors (as flavor reveals itself at warmer temps).  Anyone I know who appreciates craft beer would agree that the beers, apart from maybe the pilsner, should not be served this way.  I enjoy tasting all the flavors and complexity of my beer and not having it all be killed by an ice-cold glass.  And to try to convince people this is a better way to drink beer is just misguided.  \\n3.  I am APPALLED by the fact that they try to create new beer styles by mixing two beers.  You do not make a brown ale by mixing a pilsner and and a stout.  And you don't make another style by mixing different proportions of the same two beers.  I don't even know what to say about this.  I started laughing when I saw them pouring the beer.  You are lying to your customers and cheating them by making them think they are drinking something they are not.  This, again, is so lazy it makes me sick.  Either brew the beer or don't brew the beer and be honest enough to serve what you actually created. Hell, you could have served 30 different beers.   Hey everyone!  We have 30 beers on tap!!  We take two beers and mix them in different amounts to create 30 unique brews!  Disgusting.  \\n\\nHere is what I liked:\\n\\n1.  The food was fine.  Standard bowling alley food.  \\n2.  When I mentioned that I didn't like the beer, the brewer introduced himself and was pleasant and receptive to my feedback.  Although he didn't quite understand what I was trying to say and was trying to humor me, he did not get defensive or argumentative.  He was clearly open to feedback, which is very important and something I respected.  However, I doubt I had much impact.\\n3.  The brewing equipment looked amazing and the location for opening a brewpub was fun.  I love bowling, and I love craft beer.  If I enjoyed the beer, I'd be there all the time!!!\\n\\nI'm glad this place seems to be doing well and some people seem to like it.  I want it to be successful.

Another plus is that they charge only $2 for delivery unlike the other exorbitant chains around here! They give you an actual estimated time frame for your delivery. And actual window, ie. 9:33-9:48. Can ya believe that? My pizza was delivered within that window. Plus. Only thing, the pie was cut into squares and I didn't expect that. I guess it helps with portion control, though. Also, the pie seemed to have a tough ride. A few squares were flipped over in the box. Not that big a deal. I was too hungry to mind.

I called back a 2nd time and got another manager named Ernest. Ernest was not the orginal manager that I spoke to. We established this during my call. I was very upset when I called and he could tell. Ernest told me that the orginal manager never put the coupon in the system for my free soda and that's why he told the delivery man that I needed to pay for it.

She offers to refund me for the pizza, and I repeat my request. She responds, with a chuckle, Ma'am, you paid with a card. How am I supposed to refund you? If I did that, I'd have to refund everything and then recharge you for the pizza. Umm...what's the problem with that? Isn't that the least you can do to make this right?

Again, she offers no sense of timing for this, and I explain that I'm trying to save them a trip and just ask if she can refund all or at least half of what I paid for the wings.

The thing is, I'd understand the reluctance to provide a refund if I were a chronic complainer, but I've ordered from here several times and never complained, not even two weeks ago, when the wings I ordered could better be described as nuggets.
